### Shell layout

- In order to use flexbox in a relatively complex layout, it is advisable to plan ahead before typing the html code. For that, I used GIMP and divided the shell into 1 row and 6 columns. It was very helpful this outline to be able to match the shape of the shell. I placed it as a background image:

- Then I advanced subdividing every column into more rows. The curves were defined using **border-radius** property and some **rotate()** function when needed.

  ```css
  body {
      background-image: url("../media/Gamegear_outline.svg");
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      background-size: 60em 31em;
  }
  
  #_12 {
      height: 10.2em;
      width: 2em;
      background: rgba(255, 166, 0, 0.5);
      border-radius: 100% 0 0 0;
      transform: rotate(1.5deg);
  }
  ```

- To reduce as much as possible duplicated code, I defined some classes to apply them to various div elements:

  ```css
  .flex {
      display: flex;
  }
  
  .flex-end {
      align-items: flex-end;
      justify-content: flex-end;
  }
  
  .row {
      flex-direction: row;
  }
  
  .column {
      flex-direction: column;
  }
  ```
